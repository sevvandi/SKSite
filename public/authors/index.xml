      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! ðŸ‘‹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a mathematician working on  data science related topics such as anomaly detection, meta-learning, streaming data and statistical and machine learning related research projects. I conduct research on theoretical and real-world problems. For example,  visualizing anomalies in high dimensions is a very tricky business.  How can we reduce dimensions in a way that anomalies are highlighted or brought to the forefront? (For details, see dobin.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before my interest sparked on statistical learning, I conducted research in geometric analysis, which is a branch of pure mathematics. In fact, by PhD was in mean curvature flow, which is in the intersection of partial differential equations and differential geometry. I like to bring my geometric intuition to solve data science problems.&lt;/p&gt;

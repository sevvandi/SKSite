      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! 👋 This site is still under construction. So, many sections are in their template form. I&amp;rsquo;m currently migrating from my &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/sevvandik&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;previous site&lt;/a&gt; to this one. As this is still work in progress, my previous site has more accurate information about me. This will change soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a mathematician working on  data science related topics such as anomaly detection, meta-learning, streaming data and statistical and machine learning related research projects. I conduct research on theoretical and real-world problems. For example,  visualizing anomalies in high dimensions is a very tricky business.  How can we reduce dimensions in a way that anomalies are highlighted or brought to the forefront? (For details, see dobin.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come to statistical learning from a pure mathematics background.  My PhD was in mean curvature flow, which lies in the intersection of partial differential equations and differential geometry. I like to bring my geometric intuition to solve data science problems.&lt;/p&gt;

So, if we have a dataset of \\(N\\) independent observations, where each observation is of dimension \\(p\\), dobin can be used to find a new basis, such that the outliers of this dataset are highlighted using fewer basis vectors (see here).\nBut, how do we use dobin for time series data? Dobin is not meant for raw time series data because it is time-dependent. But we can break a time series into consecutive non-overlapping windows and compute features of data in each window using an R package such as tsfeatures. If we compute \\(d\\) features, then data in each time series window will be denoted by a point in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\).\nA Synthetic Example\rLetâ€™s look at an example. We make a normally distributed time series of length \\(6000\\) and insert an outlier at the position \\(1010\\).\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)\rlibrary(tsfeatures)\rlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(dobin)\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rset.seed(1)\r# Generate 6000 random normally distributed points for a time series\ry \u0026lt;- rnorm(6000)\r# Insert an additive outlier at position 1010\ry[1010] \u0026lt;- 6\rdf \u0026lt;- cbind.data.frame(1:6000, y)\rcolnames(df) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Index\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Value\u0026quot;)\rggplot(df, aes(Index, Value)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()\rNow, let us break the time series into non-overlapping chunks of length \\(50\\), i.e.Â we get \\(120\\) chunks or windows. Why do we use non-overlapping windows? If we use overlapping windows, say sliding by \\(1\\), the outlying point in the time series contributes to \\(50\\) windows. Later, when we compute features of these time series windows, these \\(50\\) windows will have similar features, but they will not be outliers in the feature space, because there are \\(50\\) of them. That is why we use non-overlapping windows.\nAlso, note that we need the time series to have a decent length to compute features.

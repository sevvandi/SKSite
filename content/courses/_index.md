I do not teach at the moment, but I have taught many courses since 2011. 

## [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/school-of-mathematics)  
In 2017, I taught a part of MTH3310 - Applied Mathemataical Modelling to 3rd year mathematics students. 

## [DigiPen Singapore](https://www.digipen.edu.sg/) 
From August 2011 till August 2015, I worked as an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. During this time I taught a variety of courses including Linear Algebra, Calculus, Numerical Methods and Discrete Mathematics.  

I also have used innovative methods to teach. 

### Flip-style lectures 
The students are assigned video lectures which they need to watch before coming to class. During class, the concepts are briefly revisited and challenging problems are worked out. 

### Mathematics Labs
I have designed lab components for some mathematics courses. These labs concentrate on applications and are conducted in a very interactive manner. 

### Similar to clickers
Similar to clickers, I've used an SMS based program to capture student answers to questions asked during lectures. This program changed the traditional classroom to an interactive and dynamic environment. 
 
## Student Evaluations
Both at Monash and DigiPen, I have consistently received excellent reviews from students. I have been often described as an "awesome" lecturer with a "passion to make you understand".


## Supervision
I have conducted independent studies, which are similar to Honours projects in an Australian context.

I currently teach MATH2200 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics -  at RMIT. 

## Supervision
Currently, I am supervising Work Integrated Learning (WIL) projects at RMIT. Previously, I have conducted independent studies, which are similar to Honours projects in an Australian context. 


## Previous teaching experience
### [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/school-of-mathematics)  
In 2017, I taught a part of MTH3310 - Applied Mathemataical Modelling to 3rd year mathematics students. 

### [DigiPen Singapore](https://www.digipen.edu.sg/) 
From August 2011 till August 2015, I worked as an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. During this time I taught a variety of courses including Linear Algebra, Calculus, Numerical Methods and Discrete Mathematics.  

I have also used innovative methods to teach. 

#### Flip-style lectures 
The students are assigned video lectures which they need to watch before coming to class. During class, the concepts are briefly revisited and challenging problems are worked out. 

#### Mathematics Labs
I have designed lab components for some mathematics courses. These labs concentrate on applications and are conducted in a very interactive manner. 

#### Similar to clickers
Similar to clickers, I've used an SMS based app to capture student answers to questions asked during lectures. This app changed the traditional classroom to an interactive and dynamic environment.

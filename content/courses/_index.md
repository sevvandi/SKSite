##  Previous teaching experience
### [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/science/contact/mathematical-sciences)
1. MATH2201 - Basic Statistical Methodologies
2. MATH1275/1276 - Statistical Computing
3. MATH2200 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics


### [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/school-of-mathematics)  
In 2017, I taught a part of MTH3310 - Applied Mathemataical Modelling to 3rd year mathematics students. 

### [DigiPen Singapore](https://www.digipen.edu.sg/) 
From August 2011 till August 2015, I worked as an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. During this time I taught a variety of courses including Linear Algebra, Calculus, Numerical Methods and Discrete Mathematics.  

I have also used innovative methods to teach. 

#### Flip-style lectures 
The students are assigned video lectures which they need to watch before coming to class. During class, the concepts are briefly revisited and challenging problems are worked out. 

#### Mathematics Labs
I have designed lab components for some mathematics courses. These labs concentrate on applications and are conducted in a very interactive manner.

Before the 2020 self-isolation period (also known as the lockdown) <a href="https://acems.org.au/our-people/tim-macuga">Tim Macuga</a> from ACEMS and I informally interviewed <a href="https://www.patriciamenendez.com/">Patricia Menéndez</a> from Monash University and made a podcast. Even though it was an informal chat, it was pretty special because it was about Patricia’s <a href="https://homewardboundprojects.com.au/about/">Homeward Bound</a> trip to Antarctica.</p>
<p>I felt she took us there with her evocative expressions. This podcast is part of the ACEMS podcast series <em>Random Sample</em> and can be found at <a href="https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-24-Antarctic-Outreach" class="uri">https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-24-Antarctic-Outreach</a> where there are lovely pictures of Antarctica. Don’t miss it.</p>

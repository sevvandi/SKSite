In this episode I spoke to [Prof Kate Smith-Miles](https://katesmithmiles.wixsite.com/home) about [OPTIMA](https://optima.org.au/). OPTIMA is an ARC Training Centre and it stands for Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications. Kate spoke a lot about the importance of industry collaborations and how to build successful relationships with the industry. 

As usual Tim Macuga of ACEMS helped me with this podcast. This was all done on Zoom. This podcast is available at https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-60-optima

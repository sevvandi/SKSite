In this episode I spoke to <a href="https://katesmithmiles.wixsite.com/home">Prof Kate Smith-Miles</a> about <a href="https://optima.org.au/">OPTIMA</a>. OPTIMA is an ARC Training Centre and it stands for Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications. Kate spoke a lot about the importance of industry collaborations and how to build successful relationships with the industry.</p>
<p>As usual Tim Macuga of ACEMS helped me with this podcast. This was all done on Zoom. This podcast is available at <a href="https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-60-optima" class="uri">https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-60-optima</a></p>

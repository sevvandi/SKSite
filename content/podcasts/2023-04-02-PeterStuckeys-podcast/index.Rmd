After a hiatus, I got a chance to do an episode for the Random Sample. I really enjoyed talking to Prof Peter Stuckey. He has done a lot in the optimisation domain and it was fascinating to talk to him. Peter is the Deputy Director of OPTIMA and he spoke of very cool optimisation problems. The podcast is available at https://www.therandomsample.com.au/podcast/discrete-optimisation/

As usual, Tim Macuga was helping me in the background. Thanks Tim.

<p><strong>Industry PhDs</strong></p>
<p>I did two more podcasts in 2023 for the Random Sample. One podcast was on industry PhDs. Industry PhDs give a lot more options for the PhD candidates in terms of jobs. And they get to see how the industry views research as well.</p>
<p>For this podcast I chatted to 3 OPTIMA PhD students at Melbourne University â€“ Hritika Gupta, Harry McArthur and Nico Andres Thio. The podcast is available at <a href="https://www.therandomsample.com.au/podcast/industry-phds/" class="uri">https://www.therandomsample.com.au/podcast/industry-phds/</a>.</p>

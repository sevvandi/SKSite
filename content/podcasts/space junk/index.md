We humans leave such a lot of junk in space. If you're interested in space junk, you can listen to two podcasts that I co-conducted with [Anthony Mays](https://acems.org.au/our-people/anthony-mays) on the topic. These episodes were part of the ACEMS podcast series *Random Sample* and can be found at https://acems.org.au/podcast/episodes12-13-space-junk-shield-tech.   


In the first episode, we talk about space junk and one of the related research papers that I wrote with [Dr Shannon Ryan](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/staff/dr-shannon-ryan) from DST Group and [Prof Kate Smith-Miles](https://katesmithmiles.wixsite.com/home). 


In the second episode we interview Shannon and [Prof Bill Schonberg](https://people.mst.edu/faculty/wschon/), two space junk experts about space craft shields and the lastest technology.

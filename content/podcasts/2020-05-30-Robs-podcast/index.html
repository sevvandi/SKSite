<p>Are you interested in forecasting? Well, <a href="https://acems.org.au/our-people/anthony-mays">Anthony Mays</a> and myself did a podcast with <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/">Prof Rob Hyndman</a> from Monash University on this topic. This episode is a part of the ACEMS podcast series <em>Random Sample</em> and can be found at <a href="https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-29-forecasting-the-future" class="uri">https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-29-forecasting-the-future</a></p>
<p>In this episode, Rob explains time series forecasting really well. He gives such interesting anecdotes from his vast experience. I really enjoyed conducting this podcast, so much so that I forgot to take a photo. That is my only regret.</p>

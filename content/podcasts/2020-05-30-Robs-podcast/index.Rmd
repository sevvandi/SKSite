Are you interested in forecasting? Well, [Anthony Mays](https://acems.org.au/our-people/anthony-mays) and myself did a podcast with [Prof Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/) from Monash University on this topic. This episode is a part of the ACEMS podcast series *Random Sample* and can be found at https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-29-forecasting-the-future  


In this episode, Rob explains time series forecasting really well. He gives such interesting anecdotes from his vast experience. I really enjoyed conducting this podcast, so much so that I forgot to take a photo. That is my only regret.

In this episode I spoke to <a href="https://www.dicook.org/">Prof Di Cook</a> about data visualization and reproducibility in research. Di spoke about the challenges in visualizing data in high dimensions and how she became interested in data visualization. She also spoke about the importance of reproducible research. Di has a great phrase for reproducibility, “if I can do it, you can do it too!” Di says that sums it up.</p>
<p>As usual Tim Macuga of ACEMS helped me with this podcast. This was all done on Zoom. This podcast is available at <a href="https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-64-di-cook" class="uri">https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-64-di-cook</a></p>

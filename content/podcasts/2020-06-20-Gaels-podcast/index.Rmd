During the 2020 self-isolation period [Tim Macuga](https://acems.org.au/our-people/tim-macuga) from ACEMS and I interviewed [Prof Gael Martin](http://users.monash.edu.au/~gmartin/) from Monash University via zoom and made a podcast. This is available at https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-32-bayes-theorem. 

Gael gave a brief history of the Bayes Theorem and explained how it became so powerful a tool in today's computational world. She gave examples and explained some theoretical stuff too. Pretty cool!

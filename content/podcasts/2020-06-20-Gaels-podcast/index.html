During the 2020 working-from-home period <a href="https://acems.org.au/our-people/tim-macuga">Tim Macuga</a> from ACEMS and I interviewed <a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~gmartin/">Prof Gael Martin</a> from Monash University via zoom and made a podcast. This is available at <a href="https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-32-bayes-theorem" class="uri">https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-32-bayes-theorem</a>.</p>
<p>Gael gave a brief history of the Bayes Theorem and explained how it became so powerful a tool in todayâ€™s computational world. She gave examples and explained some theoretical stuff too. Pretty cool!</p>

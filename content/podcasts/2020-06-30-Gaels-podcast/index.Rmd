During the 2020 working-from-home period [Tim Macuga](https://acems.org.au/our-people/tim-macuga) from ACEMS and I interviewed [Prof Gael Martin](http://users.monash.edu.au/~gmartin/) from Monash University via zoom and made a podcast. This is available at https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-32-bayes-theorem. 

Gael gave a brief history of the Bayes Theorem and explained how it became so powerful a tool in today's computational world. She gave examples and explained some theoretical stuff too. Pretty cool! 


In this episode she also explains the differences between Bayesian and Frequentist paradigms and discusses how Bayesian computation developed over the years.

Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! :wave:  

I work on statistical machine learning and data science research. I am interested in anomaly and event detection, algorithm evaluation and fairness and applications in spatio-temporal data and networks. There are more links between these topics than meets the eye. Sometimes linking different topics gives us better insights. Isn't it fun when that happens.

I am a Senior Research Scientist at Australia's National Science Agency, CSIRO. At CSIRO's Data61 I work on interesting cutting-edge scientific research. I work with other researchers who come from different backgrounds like biology and social science. It is fascinating to work with people from different disciplines and see "Science at Work"! I really enjoy these interactions and love the experience. 

To give a bit of my background I am an applied mathematician. My PhD was in mean curvature flow, which is in the intersection of differential geometry and partial differential equations. I have seen researchers from different backgrounds -- engineering, biology, computer science, statistics, mathematics -- work on machine learning and artificial intelligence problems. We all bring different strengths to the table that help to propel the field forward. 

My [CV](/img/CV.pdf) has more details.

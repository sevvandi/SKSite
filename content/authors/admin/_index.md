Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! :wave:  

I work on statistical machine learning and data science research. I am interested in many things. Lately, I've been interested in networks or graphs. There is a lot of cool mathematics related to graphs. Previously, I've worked on anomaly and event detection and algorithm evaluation. I still work on these topics, but somewhat less than I used to.  There are more links between these topics than meets the eye. Sometimes linking different topics gives us better insights.  It is fun when that happens. I also work on applications where AI is used in Science. This is a growing area, encompassing many topics and disciplines. 

I am a Senior Research Scientist at Australia's National Science Agency, CSIRO. My work website is [here](https://people.csiro.au/K/S/sevvandi-kandanaarachchi). At CSIRO's Data61 I work on interesting cutting-edge scientific research. I work with other researchers who come from different backgrounds like biology and social science. It is fascinating to work with people from different disciplines and see "Science at Work"! I really enjoy these interactions and love the experience. 

I am a multi-disciplinary researcher, an applied mathematician by training. To give a bit of my background my PhD was in mean curvature flow, which is in the intersection of differential geometry and partial differential equations. There is a lot of mathematics in AI and  machine learning. I love learning new mathematics and computer science concepts.

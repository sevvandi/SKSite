Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! :wave:  

I work on statistical machine learning and data science research. I am interested in anomaly and event detection, algorithm evaluation and fairness and applications in spatio-temporal data and networks. There are more links between these topics than meets the eye. Sometimes linking different topics gives us better insights. Isn't it fun when that happens.

I am a Senior Research Scientist at Australia's National Science Agency, CSIRO. At CSIRO's Data61 I work on interesting cutting-edge scientific research. I work with other researchers who come from different backgrounds like biology and social science. It is fascinating to work with people from different disciplines and see "Science at Work"! I really enjoy these interactions and love the experience. 

I am an applied mathematician. I came to statistical machine learning from a  mathematics background.  My PhD was in mean curvature flow, which is in the intersection of differential geometry and partial differential equations. A mathematical background helps me to learn new things quickly. 

More details can be found on my [CV](/img/CV.pdf).

Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! :wave:  

I am a mathematician working on  data science related topics such as anomaly detection, meta-learning and streaming data. I conduct research on theoretical and real-world problems. For example,  visualizing anomalies in high dimensions is a very tricky business.  How can we reduce dimensions in a way that anomalies are highlighted or brought to the forefront? (For details, see [dobin](https://sevvandi.github.io/dobin/index.html)).

I come to statistical learning from a pure mathematics background.  My PhD was in mean curvature flow, which lies in the intersection of partial differential equations and differential geometry. I like to bring my geometric intuition to solve data science problems. More details can be found on my [CV](/img/CV.pdf).

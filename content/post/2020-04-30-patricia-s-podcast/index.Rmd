Before the 2020 self-isolation period (also known as the lockdown) [Tim Macuga](https://acems.org.au/our-people/tim-macuga) from ACEMS and I informally interviewed [Patricia Men√©ndez](https://www.patriciamenendez.com/) from Monash University and made a podcast. Even though it was an informal chat, it was pretty special because it  was about Patricia's [Homeward Bound](https://homewardboundprojects.com.au/about/) trip to Antarctica. 

I felt she took us there with her evocative expressions. This podcast is part of the ACEMS podcast series *Random Sample* and can be found at https://acems.org.au/podcast/episode-24-Antarctic-Outreach where there are lots of lovely pictures of Antarctica. Don't miss it.

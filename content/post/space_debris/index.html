<p>We humans leave such a lot of junk in space. If youâ€™re interested in space junk, you can listen to two podcasts that I co-conducted with <a href="https://acems.org.au/our-people/anthony-mays">Anthony Mays</a> on the topic. These episodes were part of the ACEMS podcast series <em>Random Sample</em> and can be found <a href="https://acems.org.au/podcast/episodes12-13-space-junk-shield-tech">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the first episode, we talk about space junk and one of the related research papers that I wrote with <a href="https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/staff/dr-shannon-ryan">Dr Shannon Ryan</a> from DST Group and <a href="https://katesmithmiles.wixsite.com/home">Prof Kate Smith-Miles</a>.</p>
<p>In the second episode we interview Shannon and <a href="https://people.mst.edu/faculty/wschon/">Prof Bill Schonberg</a>, two space junk experts about space craft shields and the lastest technology.</p>
